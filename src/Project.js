                <br />

                <p>Eritrea is an enchanting Country. Nature is absolutely stunning and the tourist is amazed by its variety. “Three seasons in two hours” is a popular expression to describe the journey from Asmara to Massawa. The touristic potential of the Country is huge, in spite of the extremely low number of tourists.</p>
                <br />
                <h4>WEATHER</h4>
                <p>The weather in Eritrea changes dramatically from the highlands to the lowlands. In the Eritrean plateau (2.400 meters above sea level) weather is gentle. Temperature never raises over 30-35 degrees, while in winter it can reach 5-10 degrees at night. Humidity is scarce and the heat never oppressive. Tourists must be aware, instead, of the power of solar rays and of the risk of dehydration. There are two humid seasons: the “small-rains season” (April-May) and the “great-rains season” (July-August). In the rest of the year rain is scarce. There could be no precipitation at all for months. In the lowlands heat can be extremely high. During summer in some days temperature never goes below 40 degrees. Humidity is high. These harsh conditions are even worse in the Danakil depression. Rains are quite well distributed during all year round, even though during winter they are more frequent.</p> 
                <h4>CITIES</h4>
                <p>Asmara – The capital is characterized by a marvelous stratification of urbanistic and architectural Italian styles of the period 1890- 940: neoclassic, liberty, art deco, rationalistic and futuristic buildings make Asmara one of the most enchanting and interesting cities in Africa. From the monumental movie theaters built in the 30s to the different outstanding villas in the Villas Quarter, from the unique FIAT Tagliero station to the Cathedral, from the markets to the Great Mosque, from central postal office to the historic bars in the city center, Asmara is definitely a very surprising city, where the Italian style mix with the local atmosphere and creates something unique.
                    Massawa – The city could be truly a pearl of the Red Sea. Different styles are present at the same time in various buildings, many of them built with white-coral bricks. Unfortunately, the old city was severely devastated during the wars with Ethiopia and never recovered. A great effort would be needed in order to renovate or rebuild entire parts of the city.
                    Keren – Also in Keren various buildings of the colonial age can be found.</p>
                <h4>DAHLAK ISLANDS</h4>
                <p>The Dahlak Islands archipelago is probably the most popular (and the most beautiful indeed) tourist attraction of the country. 360 coral islands (only a dozen can be visited) surrounded by a considerable coral reef and a stunning variety of marine life. On the islands there are no hosting facilities, therefore visitors must care about all the things needed for their stay: tents, water supply, food…</p>
